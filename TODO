urgent:
- replace "caption" with "title"
- add a table of contents to the FAQ
- add beta testers
- change name

not urgent:
- NIM_SETVERSION does not work in the release build. The reason is unknown so far.
- m_pLink->SetPath in ConnectedShortcut::connect changes the working directory. Find the reason!
- A RegistryException once appeared in connected with taskbar-pinned Connected Shortcuts. Not reproducable.
