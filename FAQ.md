## Q: I typed "Photoshop" into the text box, but the Photoshop window doesn't  
appear in the list.

**A:** This is because Photoshop's window caption doesn't actually contain the 
word "Photoshop".
Use the filter phrase ".psd" instead.

If you are on the "Target Windows" page of AutoSave's options window, you will
notice the bottom line. If you hover the mouse over a window, this line will
show that window's caption.

You can use this tool to find out what to enter in the top text box.



## Q: Is it possible that AutoSave starts whenever I open <DOCUMENT TYPE>?

**A:** Not without screwing around with your system in unethical ways.

Windows remembers file type associations in a global database called registry.
Every applications registers an entry for each file type it wants to be 
associated with.
If you wanted to start AutoSave whenever you open a PSD file, AutoSave would 
have to manipulate these entries that belong to other applications.

That's as if, say, Photoshop was working in an office and was happy that it 
just completed all its paperwork, and suddenly, AutoSave would jump in through 
the window, grab all of Photoshop's forms, strike out "Photoshop" on each of 
them and scribble "AutoSave" on them instead in small, ugly letters.

It's a bit invasive.
